# Deep_URL_Classification
Web Traffic Classification using Generative AI

In the world of web filtering, URL categorization plays a crucial role. It's the process of assigning a website address (URL) to a pre-defined category, like social media, news, entertainment, or travel. This helps organizations filter content, manage bandwidth usage, and enforce security policies.


Currently, organizations relies on Third party vendor, a paid external database, to classify URLs into pre-defined categories like social media, news, or travel. This approach has a downside: organizations incurs ongoing costs for each URL categorization because of third-party service.
The proposed solution leverages AI to remove dependency on third party. By training an AI model to analyze URLs, organizations can achieve the same categorization task without relying on an external database. This eliminates the recurring expense associated with Third-party and brings the URL categorization process in-house.
